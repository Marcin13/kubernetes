    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80          # Map this service port to a different port on the host some times ( 502 Bad Gateway nginx, if was mistake in targetPort and port is difrent than targetPort )

  type: ClusterIP
  #type: LoadBalancer    #NOT WORKING!# Kubernetes will request a LoadBalancer from your cloud provider, and it will assign an external IP address or DNS name to your Service. If you're using a local Kubernetes cluster (like Kind), it may not work exactly like a cloud-based LoadBalancer, but it should still provide external access.
